<p>In its day, Electric Duet was a technological marvel, allowing two-voice music to be played on Apple ][ hardware capable of generating only square waves with 1-bit resolution.  <strong>ed2midi</strong> tries to convert those old music files into a midi format, usable on a variety of software systems today.</p>

<p><strong>ed2midi</strong> is <em>not</em> full-featured.  Its purpose is to get the audio out of these <code>M.*</code> files and into a usable file format.  There are no options for tempo, voices, or transposing. All of this and more can be accomplished with other midi software.</p>

<p>Getting your Electric Duet files in to a system capable of running <strong>ed2midi</strong> can be quite a feat.  There are numerous Apple ][ resources on the world-wide internet, so get to Google-ing.</p>

<h1 id="fileformat">file format</h1>

<p>Electric Duet files are a collection of 3-byte records.</p>

<p>If the first byte is $00, then it's a voice.  See below.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the first byte is the duration, measured in some number of machine cycles.  Bigger values mean longer values.  $20 is translated as a quarter note.  $40 is half note, etc. In-between values are allowed for ritardando and accelerandos, or if you need a string of eight-note quintuplets; <strong>ed2midi</strong> will dumbly quantize to "normal" note lengths, or unceremoniously fail if given an odd-ball duration.</p>

<p>The second and third bytes are the note values for track one and track two, respectively. $36 corresponds to middle C.  Doubling the value lowers the note one octave; halving goes up an octave.  (See the Excel file for mapping Electric Duet values to MIDI note values.)</p>

<p>In-between values are allowed, so if 12-tone chromatic music isn't your thang, Electric Duet will let you find something between C and C&#9839; or between A and B&#9837;.  <strong>ed2midi</strong> tries to round to the nearest note neighbor, but will more likely just fail unceremoniously if given an odd-ball note value.</p>

<p>(This is used to great effect in some of the Electric Duet sample songs.  With one track playing a pure note, and the other track playing an off-by-one value, a "heterodyning" effect could be heard.  This will be lost in <strong>ed2midi</strong>.)</p>

<h2 id="voices">voices</h2>

<p>Electric Duet allows different "instruments" (which Electric Duet calls "voices"). $00 being the "pure" square waves we know and love, and increasing values becoming buzzier (for lack of a better word).  These values don't correspond to any real-world instruments; instead they tweak the sound-generating algorithm in some mysterious way.  In my experience, values above $08 didn't seem to make a difference.</p>

<p><strong>ed2midi</strong> takes these voice numbers, and maps them directly to MIDI program changes, with the Electric Duet voice number mapping directly to MIDI standard instruments ($00=Acoustic Grand Piano, $01=Bright Acoustic Piano, $02=Electric Grand Piano, etc.)  Remember, <strong>ed2midi</strong> isn't full-featured; if you don't like these mappings, you can change them in your MIDI editor.</p>

<p>If the first byte of the record is $00, it is a voice change (and not the aforementioned duration).  The second byte is the voice for track 1, and the third byte is the voice for track 2.</p>

<h2 id="dos33">DOS 3.3</h2>

<p>Depending on how you get your files off of your Apple ][ media, your Electric Duet music files may have a four-byte prefix.  This is added by DOS 3.3 for all binary files: the first two bytes are the load address (little-endian, natch), and the next two bytes are the length.  (Some Apple ][ disk reading software strips these off; others don't.)  All Electric Duet files are saved with a load address of $4000, so if the first two bytes are $00, $40, <strong>ed2midi</strong> skips the first four bytes entirely.  (An Electric Duet file beginning with $00, $40 isn't strictly illegal, but <em>is</em> highly unlikely.)</p>
